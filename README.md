As for this workflow, we use datasets from [Domcke et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16462), GEO accession GSE67867.  
These include ChIP-seq samples for the transcription factor NRF1 and the histone mark H3K27ac (lysine 27 acetylation on histone H3; used as a marker  for active enhancers). Experiments were done with wild type (WT) as well as DNA methylation mutant (TKO; triple knockout for DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b)  
mouse embryonic stem cells. So, all in all we begin with 10 chip-seq samples.
