#Investigating Replicate with Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR):  
As with any expriment it is always a good idea to have multiple measurements of any object of interest. If we are measuring any genuine effect in  
some experiment, we should get similar observation if we have to repeat the experiment. similary, if we observing a peak in a particular genomic region in a chip-seq experiment  
we should get almost equivalent measure of peak for that region in a replicate experiment. And ideally, this observation of peak mapping in replicate  
samples should extend to all genuine peaks. This way we are sure of peak signal as a true peak. IDR serve as a metric to identify genuine peaks based  
on their reproducibility across replicates. It is a statistical framework and the main idea behind this is to generate a `peak` list of each replicate  
with lenient threshold. Doing this will generate true genuine `peaks` as well as some noise `peaks`. If we rank `peaks` from all the replicate and look  
for the correlation, we observe that the gennuine `peaks` are all well correlated while noise `peaks` are not.  

## we will look at the consistency between replicates:  
fist step is to rerun `macs2` with relaxed p-value to identify lot many peaks; default is 1e-5, but we take 1e-3  
```bash
control=NRF1_INPUT_TKO
for sample in NRF1_CHIP_TKO_1 NRF1_CHIP_TKO_2   
	do
	macs2 callpeak -t reads/${sample}.bam\
	-c reads/${control}.bam \
	-f BAM \
	-g mm \
	 --outdir chipseq-project/IDR/peaks/ \
	 --bdg \
	 -p 1e-3 \
	 -n ${sample}  2> chipseq-project/IDR/logs/${sample}_macs2_report.log
	done
  ```
