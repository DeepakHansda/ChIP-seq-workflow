Previouly at #7 we looked at the genuine `peaks` by assessing the reproducibilty between samples. Since we are dealing with two diffrent biological  
conditions, it will be interesting to compare `peaks` identified in those two different scenario. One may ask a question like what `peaks` are present in `condition1` but absent in `condition2` and vice versa. for such analysis we use `DiffBind` from R/Bioconductor.  
DiffBind is an R Bioconductor package that is used for identifying sites that are differentially enriched between two or more sample groups.  
### setting up for DiffBind:  
Make sure that you are inside folder `chipseq-project`  

```R
library(DiffBind)
library(tidyverse)
samples <- read.csv('meta/sample_sheet.csv')
dbObj <- dba(sampleSheet=samples)
View(samples)
dbObj <- dba.count(dbObj, bUseSummarizeOverlaps=TRUE)
dbObj
```

We can look at `PCA` plot which aggregates similar sample group together.  
```R
dba.plotPCA(dbObj,  attributes=DBA_CONDITION, label=DBA_ID)

```

Similarly we can look at correlation heatmap  
```R
plot(dbObj)
```
![plot-dba](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85447250/169584171-359428ec-574d-45db-843f-e3957e4dcab8.png)

Before doing diffrential enrichment between samples we need to establish what we need to compare aginst each other (defining contrast). Here we are looking at the diffrential enrichment between two `condition` (look at the condition column of the `dbObj` object).  
```R
dbObj <- dba.contrast(dbObj, categories=DBA_CONDITION, minMembers = 2)
```
Now we are ready to do differential enrichment analysis for two sample groups
```R
dbObj <- dba.analyze(dbObj, method=DBA_ALL_METHODS)
```
You can look at the summary of `dba.analyze`
```R
dba.show(dbObj, bContrasts=T)	
```
Since, in the `dba.analyze()` we use `method=DBA_ALL_METHOD` this will report result from both `DESeq2` and `edgeR`. It is usuallly a  
good practice to consider only those differentially enriched peaks which are identified by both methods. Look at the vendiagram.  
```R
dba.plotVenn(dbObj,contrast=1,method=DBA_ALL_METHODS)
```

One more important metrics to look at is `MA plot`: it shows the log2 transformed fold change of enrichment against the
log2 transformed average enrichment for each peak in the analysis.  
```R
dba.plotMA(dbObj, method=DBA_DESEQ2)
```
![MA-plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85447250/169599274-6d64b299-39d2-4ca6-8d4a-8bae514404ea.png)

We can also look at how the reads are distributed amongst the different classes of differentially bound sites and sample groups, for this we can use a boxplot.
```R
pvals <- dba.plotBox(dbObj)
```
![Boxplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85447250/169599679-1044bd20-f454-4acf-a0b5-8b453cad73a9.png)
 
 And, The volcano plot shows that most differential peaks have been identified in TKO condition.  
 ```R
 dba.plotVolcano(dbObj)
 ```
 ![volcanoplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85447250/169601253-caab0d9a-4256-48f9-879f-c897d0e5c281.png)
 
 After all these explorartory analysis we can now figure out which peaks are enriched in `WT` and which one are enriched in `TKO`. For this  
 first we need to find out differentially enriched peaks as identified by both `DESeq2` and `edgeR`. and after that we can figure out which set of peaks are enriched in `WT` and which ones are in `TKO`.  
 
 ```R
 report.edgeR <- dba.report(dbObj, method=DBA_EDGER)
report.deseq2 <- dba.report(dbObj, method = DBA_DESEQ2)
report.overlap.withedger <- report.edgeR[report.edgeR %over% report.deseq2,]
report.overlap.withdeseq2 <- report.deseq2[report.deseq2 %over% report.edgeR,]
report.edgeR
ranges(report.overlap.withedger)
length(ranges(report.overlap.withdeseq2))
dba.plotVenn(dbObj,contrast=1,method=DBA_ALL_METHODS)
out <- as.data.frame(report.overlap.withdeseq2)
write.table(out, file="edge_and_deseq2_overlap.txt", sep="\t", quote=F, row.names=F)

TKO_enrich <- out %>% 
  filter(FDR < 0.05 & Fold > 0) %>% 
  select(seqnames, start, end)
write.table(TKO_enrich, file="TKO_enriched.bed", sep="\t", quote=F, 
            row.names=F, col.names=F)

WT_enrich <- out %>% 
  filter(FDR < 0.05 & Fold < 0) %>% 
  select(seqnames, start, end)
write.table(WT_enrich, file="WT_enriched.bed", sep="\t", quote=F, 
            row.names=F, col.names=F)
```
