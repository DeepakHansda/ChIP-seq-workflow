Previouly at #7 we looked at the genuine `peaks` by assessing the reproducibilty between samples. Since we are dealing with two diffrent biological  
conditions, it will be interesting to compare `peaks` identified in those two different scenario. One may ask a question like what `peaks` are present  
in `condition1` but absent in `condition2` and vice versa. for such analysis we use `DiffBind` from R/Bioconductor.
